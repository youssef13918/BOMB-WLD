# This project was bootstrapped by vite (`pnpm create vite@latest . --template react-ts`) - [docs](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts)

## This template provides a minimal setup to get React working with MiniKit

### To get started, start the web server

`pnpm run dev`
